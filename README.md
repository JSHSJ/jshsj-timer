# Timer

Small timer component for different interval timings.
Very much still WIP. Wanted to set up my own timer component for 
work and learn some lit along the way.

## Project status 

- [x] Setup timer
- [x] Make multiple intervals work
- [x] Allow different templates
- [x] Rought notifications
- [ ] Allow editing and saving custom templates
- [ ] Make it more beautiful
- [ ] Improve Notifications
- [ ] Make it more configurable (styles, intl)

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

## Build

This sample uses the TypeScript compiler to produce JavaScript that runs in modern browsers.

To build the JavaScript version of your component:

```bash
npm run build
```

To watch files and rebuild when the files are modified, run the following command in a separate shell:

```bash
npm run build:watch
```

Both the TypeScript compiler and lit-analyzer are configured to be very strict. You may want to change `tsconfig.json` to make them less strict.
